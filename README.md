- **card_legalities_history**: Historical tracking of card legalities across formats
- **card_prices_history**: Historical tracking of card prices over time

### Trading System
- **trade_data**: Records buy/sell transactions (set_code, collector_number, direction, quantity, price, profit, etc.)

### Deck Building
- **decks**: Stores deck information (name, description, format, timestamps)
- **deck_cards**: Links decks to cards with quantities and sideboard status

### Key Features
- Foreign key relationships maintain data integrity
- JSON storage for complex data (prices, legalities, image_uris, card_faces)
- Automatic timestamp tracking for all data
- Support for both foil and non-foil card variants
- Historical data tracking for prices and legalities

## ELK Integration

The application includes scripts to index all MTG cards into Elasticsearch for advanced search, analytics, and full-text search capabilities.

### Prerequisites

1. **Elasticsearch Installation**: Ensure Elasticsearch is installed and running
   - Download from [Elasticsearch Downloads](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)
   - Or use Docker

2. **Configuration**: Add Elasticsearch settings to your `.env` file (see Configuration section)

### ELK Scripts

#### 1. Create Elasticsearch Index

The `create_elk_index.py` script creates an Elasticsearch index with proper mappings for all card fields:

```bash
python create_elk_index.py
```

**What it does:**
- Creates an index named `mtg_cards` (or as specified in `.env`)
- Defines mappings for all card fields from the SQLite `cards` table
- Includes nested mappings for `prices_history` from `card_prices_history` table
- Sets up proper field types (text, keyword, date, nested, etc.)
- Configures analyzers for card name searching

**Features:**
- All card fields indexed (name, mana_cost, type_line, oracle_text, etc.)
- Prices history stored as nested documents
- Support for double-faced cards (card_faces)
- Full-text search capabilities
- Keyword fields for exact matching

#### 2. Load Bulk Data to Elasticsearch

The `load_bulk_cards_to_elk.py` script downloads and indexes all cards from Scryfall's bulk data API:

```bash
python load_bulk_cards_to_elk.py
```

**What it does:**
- Downloads bulk card data from Scryfall API (default_cards dataset)
- Clears all existing documents from the index before loading
- Indexes all cards into Elasticsearch using bulk API
- Processes prices history from current prices
- Provides progress tracking and error handling

**Features:**
- Automatic clearing of existing documents before load
- Bulk indexing for performance (configurable batch size)
- Configurable delay between bulk operations to prevent overwhelming Elasticsearch
- Progress reporting every 10,000 cards
- Error handling and retry logic
- Verification of indexed cards after completion

**Bulk Data Loading:**
- Downloads the complete default_cards dataset from Scryfall
- Processes gzipped JSON data
- Indexes all card fields including:
  - Basic card information (name, mana cost, type, etc.)
  - Prices and prices history
  - Legalities across formats
  - Card images and URIs
  - Double-faced card data
  - Color identity and mana symbols

### Usage Workflow

1. **Start Elasticsearch**: Ensure your Elasticsearch instance is running

2. **Create the Index**:
   ```bash
   python create_elk_index.py
   ```

3. **Load Card Data**:
   ```bash
   python load_bulk_cards_to_elk.py
   ```
   ⚠️ **Warning**: This will download and index ALL cards from Scryfall (hundreds of thousands of cards). This process may take significant time and bandwidth.

4. **Verify**: The script will automatically verify the indexed cards and show statistics

### Index Structure

The Elasticsearch index includes:

- **Card Fields**: All fields from the SQLite `cards` table
- **Prices History**: Nested documents with price_type, price_value, currency, and recorded_at
- **Current Prices**: Object with USD, EUR, TIX prices
- **Card Faces**: Nested array for double-faced cards
- **Legalities**: Object with format names and legality status
- **Images**: Object with various image URI sizes

### Performance Tips

- **Batch Size**: Default is 100 cards per batch. Adjust based on your Elasticsearch cluster size
- **Bulk Delay**: Default is 0.1 seconds. Increase if Elasticsearch is being overwhelmed
- **Index Settings**: The index is created with 1 shard and 0 replicas by default (adjustable in `create_elk_index.py`)

### Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Check Elasticsearch is running and accessible at the configured host/port
- **SSL Errors**: Set `ELASTICSEARCH_VERIFY_CERTS=false` for self-signed certificates
- **Timeout Errors**: Increase `BULK_DELAY_SECONDS` or reduce batch size
- **Index Not Found**: Run `create_elk_index.py` before loading data
