## Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Network Errors**: Retries failed requests with delays
- **API Errors**: Continues loading other sets if one fails
- **Database Errors**: Skips problematic cards and continues
- **Keyboard Interrupt**: Gracefully handles Ctrl+C interruption
- **Individual Card Failures**: Never stops the entire process

## Configuration

You can modify these settings at the top of the script:

```python
DATABASE = 'magic_collector.db'        # Database file
REQUEST_DELAY = 0.1                    # Delay between API requests (seconds)
MAX_RETRIES = 3                        # Max retries for failed requests
RETRY_DELAY = 2                        # Delay before retrying (seconds)
```

## Alternative: Load Specific Sets

If you don't want to load ALL cards, you can:

1. **Use the main app**: Load cards for specific sets via the web interface
2. **Modify the script**: Edit the `get_all_sets()` function to filter sets
3. **Load in batches**: Run the script multiple times with different date ranges

## After Running

Once the script completes successfully, you can:

1. **Run the main app**: `python3 app.py`
2. **Browse cards**: Visit `/sets` and click on individual sets
3. **Search cards**: Use the card search functionality
4. **Build collection**: Add cards to your collection

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission errors**: Make sure the script is executable: `chmod +x load_all_cards.py`
- **Database locked**: Close the main app before running this script
- **Network issues**: The script will retry automatically, just wait
- **API rate limits**: The script includes delays to respect API limits
- **Disk space**: Ensure you have several GB of free space
- **Time commitment**: This is a long-running process (6+ hours)

## Performance Tips

- **Run overnight**: Start the script before going to bed
- **Stable connection**: Ensure stable internet connection
- **Close other apps**: Free up system resources
- **Monitor progress**: Check the output periodically

## Data Stored

For each card, the script stores:

- **Basic Info**: Name, mana cost, type, oracle text
- **Stats**: Power, toughness, CMC, rarity
- **Set Info**: Set code, collector number
- **Images**: Image URIs for different sizes
- **Prices**: Current market prices
- **Card Faces**: For double-sided cards
- **Colors**: Color identity and mana colors

## Stopping the Script

- **Ctrl+C**: Gracefully stops the script
- **Progress saved**: Cards loaded so far are saved to database
- **Resume**: You can run the script again to continue from where it left off
